# human_mouse_blastdb_project
Final project for BINF5240

Objective is to create a blast pair alignment SQL database for two species proteomes - in this case "Mouse" and "Human". The utility of this database is based on the frequent use of mouse models in research, where the objective is to find analogous biological effects in humans. This database makes it easy to access and compare such proteins in a programmatic fashion across multiple loci simultaneously.
